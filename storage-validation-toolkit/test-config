# The following variables define the target run time for each test, and the delay between tests in
# seconds. The delay can be reduced without impacting the tests, but it makes it harder to correlate
# individual tests with the charts in Cloudera Manager. 
# Defaults (seconds): testtime=3600; testdelay=120 

testtime=3600
testdelay=120

# osqd - OS Queue Depth should be kept lower than the configured nr_requests queue parameter to
# ensure that we're not intentionally flooding the queue.  On most systems nr_requests Defaults
# to 128, so 96 provides a buffer to avoid queueing at the OS.  If nr_requests is different on the
# test architecture, you should adjust osqd to approximately 75% of nr_requests.  This may limit
# the effective total throughput measured by the test.

osqd=96
